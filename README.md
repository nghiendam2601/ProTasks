The Weathery App is a simple yet feature-rich iOS application built using SwiftUI and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. It provides users with up-to-date weather information for a specific location by utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search for weather conditions in various cities and view the hourly forecast for the next 4 days.
